# linux-adventures

This is something I was doing once ina while in notebooks and pieces of paper and google keep and here and there. You see, now I don't know where these notes are, I lost them, and I' starting from scratch most of the time. Now I'm trying to document all the things I do to fix the problems I face in my linux installation. 

I do this once in a while and when I'm free, so it may not be complete and comprehensive, But I think it will improv over time.
